# Programming Language Foundations in Agda and Arend

This is the PLFA book with all code snippets rewritten in Arend.

[The book](book/README.md) is a collection of markdown files, you can read it right here on GitHub.
If you want to interact with the code snippets, clone the repo and open in IntelliJ IDEA with [Arend plugin installed](https://arend-lang.github.io/documentation/getting-started).

PLFA version: 22.08.

Arend version: 1.10.

## Attribution

This project is based on the ["Programming Language Foundations in Agda"](https://plfa.github.io/) by Philip Wadler, Wen Kokke and Jeremy G. Siek, licensed under CC-BY-4.0.
I copy each page of the book and add Arend code snippets alongside the original Agda ones. I also include solutions to the exercises in Arend.
